    abstract = { Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometers have been the dominant technology in the field of mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectroscopy for decades. Supercontinuum laser sources operating in the mid-IR spectral region now offer the potential to enrich the field of FT-IR spectroscopy due to their distinctive properties, such as high-brightness, broadband spectral coverage and enhanced stability. In our contribution, we introduce this advanced light source as a replacement for conventional thermal emitters. Furthermore, an approach to efficient coupling of pulsed mid-IR supercontinuum sources to FT-IR spectrometers is proposed and considered in detail. The experimental part is devoted to pulse-to-pulse energy fluctuations of the applied supercontinuum laser, performance of the system, as well as the noise and long-term stability. Comparative measurements performed with a conventional FT-IR instrument equipped with a thermal emitter illustrate that similar noise levels can be achieved with the supercontinuum-based system. The analytical performance of the supercontinuum-based FT-IR spectrometer was tested for a concentration series of aqueous formaldehyde solutions in a liquid flow cell (500 µm path length) and compared with the conventional FT-IR (130 µm path length). The results show a four-times-enhanced detection limit due to the extended path length enabled by the high brightness of the laser. In conclusion, FT-IR spectrometers equipped with novel broadband mid-IR supercontinuum lasers could outperform traditional systems providing superior performance, e.g., interaction path lengths formerly unattainable, while maintaining low noise levels known from highly stable thermal emitters. }

Moreover, the sanitation of surfaces hosting biofilms in such environments is a difficult task, mainly due to the great antimicrobial recalcitrance of biofilm cells. To overcome this problem and control unwanted biofilm formation, in recent years, several alternative methods, such as the use of enzymes, bacteriophages, and quorum quenching agents, have been successfully evaluated. The purpose of this chapter is to review the current knowledge related to pathogenic biofilm formation in the main food industries (meat, dairy, fresh produce, and seafood) and also to provide up-to-date data on some potential alternative or supplementary antibiofilm strategies.}

            Biofilms are an important source of contamination in food companies, yet the composition of biofilms in practice is still mostly unknown. The chemical and microbiological characterization of surface samples taken after cleaning and disinfection is very important to distinguish free-living bacteria from the attached bacteria in biofilms. In this study, sampling methods that are potentially useful for both chemical and microbiological analyses of surface samples were evaluated. In the manufacturing facilities of eight Belgian food companies, surfaces were sampled after cleaning and disinfection using two sampling methods: the scraper–flocked swab method and the sponge stick method. Microbiological and chemical analyses were performed on these samples to evaluate the suitability of the sampling methods for the quantification of extracellular polymeric substance components and microorganisms originating from biofilms in these facilities. The scraper–flocked swab method was most suitable for chemical analyses of the samples because the material in these swabs did not interfere with determination of the chemical components. For microbiological enumerations, the sponge stick method was slightly but not significantly more effective than the scraper–flocked swab method. In all but one of the facilities, at least 20\% of the sampled surfaces had more than 102 CFU/100 cm2. Proteins were found in 20\% of the chemically analyzed surface samples, and carbohydrates and uronic acids were found in 15 and 8\% of the samples, respectively. When chemical and microbiological results were combined, 17\% of the sampled surfaces were contaminated with both microorganisms and at least one of the analyzed chemical components; thus, these surfaces were characterized as carrying biofilm. Overall, microbiological contamination in the food industry is highly variable by food sector and even within a facility at various sampling points and sampling times.},

abstract = {Biofilms are comprised of microorganisms embedded in a self-produced matrix that normally adhere to a surface. In the food processing environment they are suggested to be a source of contamination leading to food spoilage or the transmission of food-borne pathogens. To date, research has mainly focused on the presence of (biofilm-forming) bacteria within food processing environments, without measuring the associated biofilm matrix components. Here, we assessed the presence of biofilms within a meat processing environment, processing pork, poultry and beef, by the detection of microorganisms and at least two biofilm matrix components. Sampling included 47 food contact surfaces and 61 non-food contact surfaces from eleven rooms within an Austrian meat processing plant, either during operation or after cleaning and disinfection. The 108 samples were analysed for the presence of microorganisms by cultivation and targeted quantitative real-time PCR based on 16S rRNA. Furthermore, the presence of the major matrix components carbohydrates, extracellular DNA and proteins was evaluated. Overall, we identified ten biofilm hotspots, among them seven of which were sampled during operation and three after cleaning and disinfection. Five biofilms were detected on food contact surfaces (cutters and associated equipment and a screw conveyor) and five on non-food contact surfaces (drains and water hoses) resulting in 9.3  of the sites being classified as biofilm positive. From these biofilm positive samples, we cultivated bacteria of 29 different genera. The most prevalent bacteria belonged to the genera Brochothrix (present in 80 of biofilms), Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter (isolated from 70  biofilms). From each biofilm we isolated bacteria from four to twelve different genera, indicating the presence of multi-species biofilms. This work ultimately determined the presence of multi-species biofilms within the meat processing environment, thereby identifying various sources of potential contamination. Especially the identification of biofilms in water hoses and associated parts highlights the need of a frequent monitoring at these sites. The knowledge gained about the presence and composition of biofilms (i.e. chemical and microbiological) will help to prevent and reduce biofilm formation within food processing environments.}

ABSTRACT={Diverse microorganisms are able to grow on food matrixes and along food industry infrastructures. This growth may give rise to biofilms. This review summarizes, on the one hand, the current knowledge regarding the main bacterial species responsible for initial colonization, maturation and dispersal of food industry biofilms, as well as their associated health issues in dairy products, ready-to-eat foods and other food matrixes. These human pathogens include Bacillus cereus (which secretes toxins that can cause diarrhea and vomiting symptoms), Escherichia coli (which may include enterotoxigenic and even enterohemorrhagic strains), Listeria monocytogenes (a ubiquitous species in soil and water that can lead to abortion in pregnant women and other serious complications in children and the elderly), Salmonella enterica (which, when contaminating a food pipeline biofilm, may induce massive outbreaks and even death in children and elderly), and Staphylococcus aureus (known for its numerous enteric toxins). On the other hand, this review describes the currently available biofilm prevention and disruption methods in food factories, including steel surface modifications (such as nanoparticles with different metal oxides, nanocomposites, antimicrobial polymers, hydrogels or liposomes), cell-signaling inhibition strategies (such as lactic and citric acids), chemical treatments (such as ozone, quaternary ammonium compounds, NaOCl and other sanitizers), enzymatic disruption strategies (such as cellulases, proteases, glycosidases and DNAses), non-thermal plasma treatments, the use of bacteriophages (such as P100), bacteriocins (such us nisin), biosurfactants (such as lichenysin or surfactin) and plant essential oils (such as citral- or carvacrol-containing oils).}

Here, we review the identity of residential bacteria and characteristics relevant for survival and growth in the food industry along with potential implications for food safety and quality. Sampling after cleaning and disinfection increases the likelihood of targeting residential bacteria. The increasing use of sequencing technologies to identify bacteria has improved knowledge about the bacteria present in food premises. Overall, nonpathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas spp., followed by Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp. dominate on food processing surfaces. Pseudomonas spp. persistence is likely due to growth at low temperatures, biofilm formation, tolerance to biocides, and low growth requirements. Gram-positive bacteria are most frequently found in dairies and in dry production environments. The residential bacteria may end up in the final products through cross-contamination and may affect food quality. Such effects can be negative and lead to spoilage, but the bacteria may also contribute positively, as through spontaneous fermentation. Pathogenic bacteria present in food processing environments may interact with residential bacteria, resulting in both inhibitory and stimulatory effects on pathogens in multispecies biofilms. The residential bacterial population, or bacteriota, does not seem to be an important source for the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes to humans, but more knowledge is needed to verify this. If residential bacteria occur in high numbers, they may influence processes such as membrane filtration and corrosion.},

ABSTRACT = {Biofilms on food-contact surfaces can lead to recurrent contamination. This work aimed to study the biofilm formation process on stainless steel plates used in the dairy industry: 304 surface finish 2B and electropolished; and the effect of a cleaning and disinfection process using alkaline (AEW) and neutral (NEW) electrolyzed water. Milk fouling during heat processing can lead to type A or B deposits, which were analyzed for composition, surface energy, thickness, and roughness, while the role of raw milk microbiota on biofilm development was investigated. Bacteria, yeasts, and lactic acid bacteria were detected using EUB-338, PF2, and Str-493 probes, respectively, whereas Lis-637 probe detected Listeria sp. The genetic complexity and diversity of biofilms varied according to biofilm maturation day, as evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequence, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization microscopy. From analysis of the experimental designs, a cleaning stage of 50 mg/L NaOH of AEW at 30 &deg;C for 10 min, followed by disinfection using 50 mg/L total available chlorine of NEW at 20 &deg;C for 5 min is a sustainable alternative process to prevent biofilm formation. Fluorescence microscopy was used to visualize the effectiveness of this process.},

ABSTRACT = {Biofilms are multicellular sessile microbial communities embedded in hydrated extracellular polymeric matrices. Their formation is common in microbial life in most environments, while those formed on food-processing surfaces are of considerable interest in the context of food hygiene. Biofilm cells express properties that are distinct from planktonic ones, in particular, notorious resistance to antimicrobial agents. Thus, a special feature of biofilms is that, once they have been developed, they are hard to eradicate, even when careful sanitization procedures are regularly applied. A great deal of ongoing research has investigated how and why surface-attached microbial communities develop such resistance, and several mechanisms are to be acknowledged (e.g., heterogeneous metabolic activity, cell adaptive responses, diffusion limitations, genetic and functional diversification, and microbial interactions). The articles contained in this Special Issue deal with biofilms of some important food-related bacteria (including common pathogens such as Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as spoilage-causing spore-forming bacilli), providing novel insights on their resistance mechanisms and implications, together with novel methods (e.g., use of protective biofilms formed by beneficial bacteria, enzymes) that could be used to overcome such resistance and thus improve the safety of our food supply and protect public health.},

RM4440 is a Pseudomonas aeruginosa FRD1 derivative that carries a plasmid-basedrecA-luxCDABE fusion. We immobilized RM4440 in an alginate matrix to simulate a biofilm, and we studied its response to UV radiation damage. The biofilm showed a protective property by physical shielding against UV C, UV B, and UV A. Absorption of UV light by the alginate matrix translated into a higher survival rate than observed with planktonic cells at similar input fluences. UV A was shown to be effectively blocked by the biofilm matrix and to have no detectable effects on cells contained in the biofilm. However, in the presence of photosensitizers (i.e., psoralen), UV A was effective in inducing light production and cell death. RM4440 has proved to be a useful tool to study microbial communities in a noninvasive manner. }

Biofilm-based infections are, as a result, extremely difficult to cure. A wide range of molecular mechanisms contribute to the high degree of recalcitrance that is characteristic of biofilm communities. These mechanisms include, among others, interaction of antimicrobials with biofilm matrix components, reduced growth rates and the various actions of specific genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance and tolerance. Alone, each of these mechanisms only partially accounts for the increased antimicrobial recalcitrance observed in biofilms. Acting in concert, however, these defences help to ensure the survival of biofilm cells in the face of even the most aggressive antimicrobial treatment regimens. This review summarises both historical and recent scientific data in support of the known biofilm resistance and tolerance mechanisms. Additionally, suggestions for future work in the field are provided.}",

abstract = {Biofilms have been of considerable interest in the context of food hygiene. Of special significance is the ability of microorganisms to attach and grow on food and food-contact surfaces under favourable conditions. Biofilm formation is a dynamic process and different mechanisms are involved in their attachment and growth. Extracellular polymeric substances play an important role in the attachment and colonization of microorganisms to food-contact surfaces. Various techniques have been adopted for the proper study and understanding of biofilm attachment and control. If the microorganisms from food-contact surfaces are not completely removed, they may lead to biofilm formation and also increase the biotransfer potential. Therefore, various preventive and control strategies like hygienic plant lay-out and design of equipment, choice of materials, correct use and selection of detergents and disinfectants coupled with physical methods can be suitably applied for controlling biofilm formation on food-contact surfaces. In addition, bacteriocins and enzymes are gaining importance and have an unique potential in the food industry for the effective biocontrol and removal of biofilms. These newer biocontrol strategies are considered important for the maintenance of biofilm-free systems, for quality and safety of foods.}

	abstract = {Biofilms are microbial communities attached to a surface and embedded in an extracellular polymeric substance which provides for the protection, stability and nutrients of the various bacterial species indwelling. These communities can build up in a variety of different environments from industrial equipment to medical devices resulting in damage, loss of productivity and disease. They also have great potential for economic and societal benefits as bioremediation agents and renewable energy sources. The great potential benefits and threats of biofilms has encouraged researchers across disciplines to study biofilm characteristics and antibiofilm strategies resulting in chemists, physicists, material scientists, and engineers, to develop beneficial biofilm applications and prevention methods. The ultimate outcome is a wealth of knowledge and innovative technology. However, without extensive formal training in microbes and biofilm research, these scientists find a daunting array of established techniques for growing, quantifying and characterizing biofilms while trying to design experiments and develop innovative laboratory protocols. This mini-review focuses on enriching interdisciplinary efforts and understanding by overviewing a variety of quantitative and qualitative biofilm characterization methods to assist the novice researcher in assay selection., This review consists of four parts. Part 1 is a brief overview of biofilms and the unique properties that demand a highly interdisciplinary approach. Part 2 describes the classical quantification techniques including colony forming unit (CFU) counting and crystal violet staining, but also introduces some modern methods including ATP bioluminescence and quartz crystal microbalance. Part 3 focuses on the characterization of biofilm morphology and chemistry including scanning electron microscopy and spectroscopic methods. Finally, Part 4 illustrates the use of software, including ImageJ and predictive modeling platforms, for biofilm analysis. Each section highlights the most common methods, including literature references, to help novice biofilm researchers make choices which commensurate with their study goals, budget and available equipment.},

              pathogens organized in biofilms has been shown to trigger chronic infections. In addition to mechanisms involving specific genetic or physiological cell properties, antibiotic sorption and/or reaction with biofilm components may lessen the antibiotic bioavailability and consequently decrease their efficiency. To assess locally and accurately the antibiotic diffusion-reaction, we used for the first time a set of advanced fluorescence microscopic tools (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and fluorescence lifetime imaging) that offer a spatiotemporal resolution not available with the commonly used time-lapse confocal imaging method. This set of techniques was used to characterize the dynamics of fluorescently labeled vancomycin in biofilms formed by two
              Staphylococcus aureus
              human isolates. We demonstrate that, at therapeutic concentrations of vancomycin, the biofilm matrix was not an obstacle to the diffusion-reaction of the antibiotic that can reach all cells through the biostructure.},

ABSTRACT = {Biofilms are a communal way of living for microorganisms in which microorganism cells are surrounded by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Most microorganisms can live in biofilm form. Since microorganisms are everywhere, understanding biofilm structure and composition is crucial for making the world a better place to live, not only for humans but also for other living creatures. Raman spectroscopy is a nondestructive technique and provides fingerprint information about an analyte of interest. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy is a form of this technique and provides enhanced scattering of the analyte that is in close vicinity of a nanostructured noble metal surface such as silver or gold. In this review, the applications of both techniques and their combination with other biofilm analysis techniques for characterization of composition and structure of biofilms are discussed.},

abstract="A rapid and inexpensive method to characterise chemical cell properties and identify the functional groups present in the cell wall is Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Infrared spectroscopy is a well-established technique to identify functional groups in organic molecules based on their vibration modes at different infrared wave numbers. The presence or absence of functional groups, their protonation states, or any changes due to new interactions can be monitored by analysing the position and intensity of the different infrared absorption bands. Additionally, infrared spectroscopy is non-destructive and can be used to monitor the chemistry of living cells. Despite the complexity of the spectra, the elucidation of functional groups on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria has been already well documented in the literature. Recent advances in detector sensitivity have allowed the use of micro-FTIR spectroscopy as an important analytical tool to analyse biofilm samples without the need of previous treatment. Using FTIR spectroscopy, the infrared bands corresponding to proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, polyphosphate groups, and other carbohydrate functional groups on the bacterial cells can now be identified and compared along different conditions. Despite some differences in FTIR spectra among bacterial strains, experimental conditions, or changes in microbiological parameters, the IR absorption bands between approximately 4,000 and 400 cm−1 are mainly due to fundamental vibrational modes and can often be assigned to the same particular functional groups. In this chapter, an overview covering the different sample preparation protocols for infrared analysis of bacterial cells is given, alongside the basic principles of the technique, the procedures for calculating vibrational frequencies based on simple harmonic motion, and the advantages and disadvantages of FTIR spectroscopy for the analysis of microorganisms.",

ABSTRACT = {Biofilms are assemblages of microbial cells, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and other components extracted from the environment in which they develop. Within biofilms, the spatial distribution of these components can vary. Here we present a fundamental characterization study to show differences between biofilms formed by Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the yeast-type Candida albicans using synchrotron macro attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) microspectroscopy. We were able to characterise the pathogenic biofilms’ heterogeneous distribution, which is challenging to do using traditional techniques. Multivariate analyses revealed that the polysaccharides area (1200–950 cm−1) accounted for the most significant variance between biofilm samples, and other spectral regions corresponding to amides, lipids, and polysaccharides all contributed to sample variation. In general, this study will advance our understanding of microbial biofilms and serve as a model for future research on how to use synchrotron source ATR-FTIR microspectroscopy to analyse their variations and spatial arrangements.},

Diffraction limited spatial resolution in reflection geometry was achieved. A multilayer film consisting of different polymers and mixtures thereof was measured and results were compared to those gained with a conventional FTIR microscope equipped with a thermal MIR source. Results show that compared to thermal sources, the application of the SC source results in higher signal-to-noise ratios together with better spatial resolution and faster scanning. Furthermore, diffraction limited imaging of red blood cells was demonstrated for the first time in the MIR spectral region in reflection mode. The distinctive characteristics of the MIR spectral region in conjunction with the high brightness, spatial coherence and broadband nature of supercontinuum radiation show the potential for improving infrared microscopy significantly.},

This means that these sources can now cover nearly all of the 800–5000 cm−1 spectrum (2–12.5 µm) which is frequently used in IR spectroscopy and microscopy. To demonstrate applicability, such an IR SC source was used for transmission spectroscopy of highly scattering filtration membranes from 3500 to 1300 cm−1, and transmission microscopy of colon tissue at 1538 cm−1.}

Bacteria are single-celled organisms. Their size varies from 0.4 to 1.5µm and most are visible under a light microscope. The majority are 1–10 µm long. They vary in shape and can be spherical, ovoid, elongated, spiral or rod-like in form and individual bacteria form chains, clusters, groups or pairs. Bacteria are prokaryotes as they lack a true cell nucleus. Their genetic material in the form of a nucleoid instead lies in the cytoplasm and is not enclosed in a nuclear membrane. Bacteria have both DNA and ribonucleic acid and reproduce asexually via binary fission, that is, splitting into two with one cell dividing into two equal daughter cells. They usually prefer a pH value near neutral, between 5.5 and 6.0, for their growth. Fungi are eukaryotes and are larger in size than bacteria. They have a more developed cell structure than bacteria and their genetic material is separated from the cytoplasm by a nuclear membrane. The primary substance in the cell wall of true fungi is chitin. All fungi are chemoheterotrophic organisms that require carbon and organic substances for living.}

abstract = {Abstract Biofilm growth in porous media is difficult to study non-invasively due to the opaqueness and heterogeneity of the systems. Magnetic resonance is utilized to non-invasively study water dynamics within porous media. Displacement-relaxation correlation experiments were performed on fluid flow during biofilm growth in a model porous media of mono-dispersed polystyrene beads. The spin–spin T2 magnetic relaxation distinguishes between the biofilm phase and bulk fluid phase due to water–biopolymer interactions present in the biofilm, and the flow dynamics are measured using PGSE NMR experiments. By correlating these two measurements, the effects of biofilm growth on the fluid dynamics can be separated into a detailed analysis of both the biofilm phase and the fluid phase simultaneously within the same experiment. Within the displacement resolution of these experiments, no convective flow was measured through the biomass. An increased amount of longitudinal hydrodynamic dispersion indicates increased hydrodynamic mixing due to fluid channeling caused by biofilm growth. The effect of different biofilm growth conditions was measured by varying the strength of the bacterial growth medium. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110: 1366–1375. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
